h3 We #[i.fa.fa-heart-o] Crouton

p This is a UI tool for interacting with ESP8266 IOT devices utilizing the MQTT protocol. The intentions are to use the ESP8266 as a hardware enabler for everyday items to become 'internet of things' enabled. Extending beyond that, it is possible to use the ESP8266s as a real-time device to device communication system that has the capability of being physically isolated.

p Each ESP8266 is called a 'crouton' in which they all communicate within a network called a 'salad'. The terms lettuce, tomato and dressing has not yet be taken.

p Bon Appetit! #[br] Edmund Fung

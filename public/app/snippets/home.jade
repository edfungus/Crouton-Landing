p What is Crouton?

p Crouton is a web application that lets you view and control you IOT devices that utilizes the MQTT protocol.

p As a hardware enthusiast, I care focus on making my device knowing there is already a frontend that can control. Plus it is so simple to hook up!

p I made a really cool IOT device but I don't have a user friendly way to interact with it... 

p This is a UI tool for interacting with ESP8266 IOT devices utilizing the MQTT protocol. The intentions are to use the ESP8266 as a hardware enabler for everyday items to become 'internet of things' enabled. Extending beyond that, it is possible to use the ESP8266s as a real-time device to device communication system that has the capability of being physically isolated.

p Each ESP8266 is called a 'crouton' in which they all communicate within a network called a 'salad'. The terms lettuce, tomato and dressing has not yet be taken.

p Bon Appetit! #[br] Edmund Fung

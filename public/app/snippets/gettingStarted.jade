h4 Getting Started

p.header You will need three things: Crouton, a MQTT broker and a device

p It is quite easy to get started. Of the three things needed, we already provide you Crouton which is free to use! There are a variety of ways to get the MQTT Broker and device free or paid. We will help you with them below.

p.header Crouton

p Crouton is available either by using the version we are #[a(href="https://github.com/edfungus/Crouton", target="_blank") hosting] (the "Crouton App" link on the right) or if you are adventurous, by downloading the source from #[a(href="https://github.com/edfungus/Crouton", target="_blank") github] and running it on your own server.

p.header Devices

p We want you to use your awesome DIY IOT device with Crouton. As long your device can use the MQTT protocol, we support it! Check out the #[a(href="/crouton/documentation") documentation] to get them connected! If you just want to try out Crouton, we have simulated devices with sdflkjsdlfk Her eis pythong file...
